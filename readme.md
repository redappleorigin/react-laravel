# Sample ReactJS and Laravel PHP Framework

## Required
- Windows 7 or greater
- Node 6 or greater
- Npm 3 or greater
- [VCRUNTIME140.dll](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145&wa=wsignin1.0), You'll need the x86 version

## Getting Started
Run the following scripts in a console of your choice, I like [cmder](http://cmder.net/).
- `npm run setup:dev` // This will create a database, install composer and npm dependencies and just generally setup a development environment for laravel.
- `npm start` // Launches a php server

In a separate console run
- `npm run dev`

The react app is located in resources/react.
